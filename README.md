# Donut App (phase 1)

Build a donut counting app to make sure there are enough donuts for your guests. Never again will you endure sleepless nights worrying if you have enough donuts on hand for your hungry friends.

## Steps

1. Fork this lab.
2. Clone the fork.
3. cd into lab folder.
4. Open in your text editor.
5. Open index.html in a browser (don't forget to open JS console in dev tools so you can see any potential error messages.)
6. Follow the code comments in **js/donut-counter.js** to write the code neccesary to build a functioning dounter counter app.
